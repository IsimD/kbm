# Remote work - best practices at Monterail 

Let‚Äôs start with the fact that remote work is not a one-size-fits-all solution. Everybody has their own ways, standards and that is absolutely fine. The aim of creating best practices is to have a basic guideline that‚Äôs clear and understandable for everyone, no matter their location. 

We know that remote work is a trend that is gaining popularity and it‚Äôs a good time to explore it more. Before creating this doc, we surveyed a number of remote Monterailians to ask them about their experiences and most importantly, their expertise in the topic. We learned a lot and gained some great new insights, which helped us shape those best practices and guidelines. 

Let us tell you more about what we found: 

#### Why do you like remote work? 
The answers to this question were similar - it‚Äôs the flexibility, more time to spend in your favourite places, less time spent commuting or travelling in general. The ability to focus intently, higher productivity and work without the office quarrel were also mentioned frequently. 

#### What challenges do you face in remote work? 
The main thing lacking in remote work is, of course, face to face contact and interaction with the team, however, there are ways to tackle this disadvantage. People also mentioned issues like -- isolation and the inability to feel the ‚Äòenergy‚Äô in the room/company. 

After the research, we know that there are good sides to remote work but also the ones that need some adjustments. 

How to make the most out of remote work and thrive in it?

### We want everyone to feel satisfied and included in their work environment - the best practices below should be useful to everyone, whether you work remotely or not :) 

#### Proactivity and inclusion 
Remote cooperation is a two-way street - it‚Äôs important for the team on both sides to communicate and update each other regularly. However, if you see that the communication process could be better, remember that you can always talk to your PM or simply point it out at your next project meeting. When it comes to communication, here are a few rules worth sticking to:
* Share what you‚Äôre doing with your team, what task you‚Äôre currently working on - don‚Äôt hesitate to write to your team if you have any questions- after all, it‚Äôs just like a normal conversation, why hold back from it? 
* Try to reply as quickly as possible to messages/requests - if you‚Äôre currently unavailable set an appropriate status on the messaging app your team is using

    For Slack, use:
    
    üçù - out for lunch - unavailable 
    
    üß† - do not disturb - it might take me a little bit longer to reply to you
    
    üóìÔ∏è - in a meeting 

* Experiment with messaging/updates and the amount of them, test out what works for all of the team members. After all, everyone has different needs. 
* Give context in a message you‚Äôre writing to someone. Sometimes, someone might not know the situation you‚Äôre in or what exactly you need help with - this is especially hard when remote. Make sure to give the background/context of your situation. 
* How about saying Hi to each other when we sit down to work? Wave a üëã in your project channel to let your team know you‚Äôre here and available (kudos to Kamnog for this little cool trick) 
* Don‚Äôt hesitate to schedule meetings if you feel you need to discuss some topic.

#### Active communication 
Communication is the ultimate basis of remote work. Without it being effective, not much can get done. 
* As already mentioned - talk, discuss, jump on a call, write notes and agendas. Proactivity and communication go hand in hand like peas and carrots. 
* Set out clear responsibilities and write them down if necessary 

* Collaborate virtually - virtual sticky notes, white boards or working on documents in real time do the trick 

* Start your call by asking if everything is working well and make sure everyone can hear one another 

* Turn on your video camera - it can bring you closer to the team, feel free to try it out. 

* Share how you‚Äôre feeling - let your team and especially your PM know if something is going super well or perhaps not so much. Make sure to inform your team if you need help with any task. 

* Update your status on Calamari - While we are in a hybrid mode, it‚Äôs still important to update your Calamari/Enova status as ‚Äòworking remotely‚Äô and give updates on any leaves you may take (sick leave, holiday), especially if you‚Äôre not a 100% remote team member. However, we don‚Äôt need to do that due to the Covid-19 outbreak since we are all remote. 

#### Take care of your health 
* Working routine -  it‚Äôs very important to treat your work from home as any other working routine - it‚Äôs best to get up, get dressed, create space for yourself and then start your day. 

* Movement - don‚Äôt forget to get up from time to time, walk around, make yourself some lunch or go out. 

* Work space - setting up a proper work space (it doesn‚Äôt have to be a separate room, but that would be even better) is hugely important. Your desk and chair is where you sit most of the day - make it a space that you enjoy being in and where you feel comfortable. 

* Work-life balance - it can be tempting to look at your laptop even though you‚Äôre finished with work. However, remember that in this case there is no physical boundary between your personal life and work life, you need to create that boundary and a healthy balance for yourself. 

### Few points on what‚Äôs best NOT to do: 

#### Don‚Äôt forget about others
This means including the people needed in a discussion, not chatting over some topic over coffee and later forgetting to update others about it. 
Update, discuss, write and communicate in any shape and form suitable for your team. Test things out and experiment with solutions to make sure it works for everyone. Flexibility here is key. 

#### Don‚Äôt replicate your office working style to remote work
Remote work isn‚Äôt simply working in a different location, it is so much more and can be a burden if we expect to behave in the same way we do when in an office environment. [GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/company/culture/all-remote/what-not-to-do/) said it on point here.

#### Don‚Äôt expect we will all be amazing at remote work with a snap of the fingers
Remote work can be considered a skill that we are all learning. While we‚Äôre figuring it out, let‚Äôs approach each other with patience and kindness. It‚Äôs good to test out approaches and tools to fit your needs, experiment with what works best for you. 

#### Jumping on calls is normal 
Don‚Äôt forget that calls and messaging are the only ways we can talk now. So, let‚Äôs make them a normal thing. When someone asks to jump on a call we should treat it the same way as if someone came up to us to talk at our desk - same thing ;) 

### Client visits 
First of all, like we said before, please  **remember that remote-first is an approach**. At Monterail, remote-first is about having a more open approach to remote work, finding what we can improve and implement solutions that will make our cross-team cooperation better, easier and more effective. *Think about remote-first as always having it at the back of your mind - a method of working, collaborating and knowledge-sharing together so that everyone (not just office employees) are involved. That‚Äôs what being remote-first is all about.*

That said, it doesn‚Äôt mean that now all client visits will be happening online. Workshops and first meetings with clients were always part of our culture and created an amazing atmosphere to start working together. As one of our strategic pillars is client focus, this still remains the same. 
So let‚Äôs keep it simple - when a client visit is being planned in our office, please take into consideration that we would like for you to be here with us. It‚Äôs crucial for some business/vision/roadmap planning and builds a great base for future cooperation. 
Of course, if there are situations where you really cannot travel/attend, we will understand, however, let‚Äôs all assume that it‚Äôs great for everyone (us and client) to meet and discuss product plans face to face especially if meetings like that don‚Äôt happen that often. 

### Communication channels 
We use quite a lot of various communication channels at Monterail. However, I believe we can all safely assume that Slack is our main communication tool at Monterail. So let‚Äôs make the best of it in our daily work. 

#### Slack 

* Update your statuses when necessary 

* Begin your day with a wave üëã (try it out) 

* Integrate as much as possible - jira, trello, bonusly etc. 

* Ask questions and get involved in team discussions

* Snooze some channels if they are too disturbing, however, it‚Äôs good to have #general on at least 

* Let others know if it‚Äôs your focus time - you might be less responsive then (treat it as an equivalent of putting your headphones on, we all know that feel, right?) 

#### Zoom Rooms 
We are now using Zoom Rooms for joining round up - you should always find the joining instructions in the weekly roundup calendar invitation. You do not need a Zoom Rooms account to join the call, however, you do need it when setting up a Zoom call. 

#### Calls

* for any call that requires the whole Monte or whole specialised team (growth, dev, pm, business support etc), we aim to use zoom.us and Heads will be handling them to happen

* for project meetings (whole team, think eg. sprint planning), we will aim to use zoom.us and the PM team will be handling those to happen

* for any call that you want/need to have with less than 10 people - use whatever you prefer

* if you need a quick call and are ok with using slack, do it. If you need to have a discussion with 2 other team members about a feature, use slack or hangouts - again, whatever you prefer and agree on. 

### Cooperation tools

#### Google Docs
Real time editing and cooperation - one of the simplest tools out there but it does a great job. We have also recently moved from Dropbox Paper to Google Docs as all of our information infrastructure is mostly in the Google Suite. 

#### Some other tools worth trying out 
* [Miro](https://miro.com/)
* [AWW App](https://awwapp.com/b/ukkdfrqiz/) 
* [Invision freehand](https://www.invisionapp.com/feature/freehand?utm_source=zapier.com&utm_mediu) - great for drawings, whiteboard sessions 
* [Google Hangouts Enterprise for free](https://gsuiteupdates.googleblog.com/2020/03/enabling-hangouts-meet-premium-features.html)
* #remote-first slack channel for knowledge sharing 
* #remotekitchen on slack 

#### Using the Google calendar 
The UI of room bookings has changed a little bit - you can now see the capacity of the room and what floor it‚Äôs on 

**Please go to Google Calendar ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Main work location** and choose whether you‚Äôre working remotely or in our office - if so then choose O≈Çawska and your main floor. This will help in easier booking of the rooms. 

The calendar will also reject a room from a meeting if every guest is declined there so please remember to decline meetings you‚Äôre not attending.

## More general considerations regarding our current situation due to the Covid-19 outbreak:

1. We are all new to this situation and learning how to work 100% fully remote. Let‚Äôs make sure we stay kind to each other 

2. This handbook was written with the #remotefirst approach in mind. Since, we are ALL working remotely now, some of the things might not apply because we are all in the same situation. 

3. Many of us are used to working remotely already as we‚Äôve always had the opportunity to work from home when needed due to personal reasons or one‚Äôs preferences. What‚Äôs changed is that we all have to do this now and it might not feel as natural for some team members, as it feels for others. 

4. It‚Äôs important to start your day as if you were going to work - get up, get ready and then fire up your computer ‚Üí it‚Äôs important to focus on your comfort and productivity as it will definitely be more beneficial in the long-term. It also means you have a more clear-cut boundary between work and leisure time.

5. Inform your team about your working hours, you can even set them up in your calendar and make sure to be present during the company‚Äôs core hours which are 10:00am to 15:00 

6. All peer review/feedback meetings will still be happening online
